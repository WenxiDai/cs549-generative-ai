# cs549-generative-ai
A tower defense game developed based on generative AI.
New update explanation:
WebGL Enemy Enhancement for Tower Defense Game
This implementation includes:
Key Files Created
1. webgl-enemies.js - The main WebGL renderer that creates and animates 3D soldier models
2. mat4.js - Matrix math utilities for 3D transformations
3. glmatrix-min.js - Mathematical foundation for WebGL operations
4. soldiers.js - 3D models and animation data for the soldiers
5. game-enhancements.js - Integration code that hooks into your existing game logic
6. effects.css - Enhanced visual effects for projectiles, impacts, and status effects
Main Features
* 3D Soldier Models: Detailed soldier models replace the original circle enemies
* Walking Animations: Realistic movement as enemies traverse the path
* Hit Reactions: Enemies visibly react when hit by tower attacks
* Death Animations: Enemies fall to the ground when killed
* Elemental Effects: Enhanced visual effects for frozen and burning states
* Improved Projectiles: Better-looking projectiles with trails and impact effects
Integration Steps
1. Add the new files to your project following the structure mentioned in the integration instructions
2. Update game_display.html to include the new scripts and CSS
3. Create texture images for the soldiers or use the provided fallbacks
4. Test the game to ensure everything works correctly
How It Works
The implementation uses a non-invasive approach that extends your existing game logic without requiring modifications to the original code. It works by:
1. Creating a WebGL canvas that overlays your game area
2. Intercepting enemy creation, movement, and destruction events
3. Rendering 3D soldier models at the positions of your original enemies
4. Hiding the original enemy elements while maintaining their logical functionality
This means all the original game logic continues to work as before, but now with much more visually appealing enemies.
Compatibility and Fallbacks
* The code automatically detects if WebGL is supported
* If WebGL isn't available, it falls back to Canvas 2D rendering
* Mobile-specific optimizations are included for better performance on smaller devices
